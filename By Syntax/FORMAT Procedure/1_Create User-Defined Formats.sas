 CREATE USER-DEFINED FORMATS TO CHANGE DISPLAYED COLUMN VALUES                                                                                  
     This program generates user-defined/custom formats using PROC FORMAT. 
     Keywords: PROC FORMAT, FORMAT, PROC CATALOG, FMTLIB, custom format                                                             
     SAS Versions: SAS 9, SAS Viya                                                    
     Documentation: https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=proc&docsetTarget=p1xidhqypi0fnwn1if8opjpqpbmn.htm
     1. VALUE statements are used to assign the source value or range to the displayed value.
     2. The Data Step with a FORMAT statement is utilized to apply the custom formats to the relevant columns.
        The FORMAT statement can also be used in Procedures.
     3. PROC CATALOG creates a summary listing of the user-defined format entries in a library.                           
     4. The FMTLIB option added to PROC FORMAT creates a list report of the user-defined format 
		definitions.                           
     Note: Formats do not change the stored value in the input table.
